#text: "Right, so we have got this duck here, and we are gonna throw it in the water to see if it floats, because, obviously, if it does, that means she is made of wood, and therefore she must be a witch! It is completely logical, dont question it, because if the duck floats, we will tie her to a chair, set her on fire, and be done with it." #No one can argue with this flawless reasoning!"
#text: "Eleventy-one years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits. I don't know half of you half as well as I should like, and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve."

Consequently, identifying these manifolds and training diffusion models directly on them can be advantageous due to the lower data dimensionality filler filler filler."
